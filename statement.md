# Statement — Mark Manager

## Problem Statement
Students often struggle to keep track of their marks across different subjects, especially when assessments happen at different times. Many students record marks in notebooks or notes apps, which becomes difficult to maintain, update, and review during exams.  
The aim of this project is to build a simple command-line Mark Manager that lets a student enter marks, update them, view totals, and quickly check subject-wise performance.

## Scope of the Project
The project focuses on a basic, in-memory mark-tracking system.  
It allows users to add subjects, store marks for multiple assessments, edit or remove entries, and view calculated results such as totals or averages.  
The scope is intentionally limited to console-based operations so that the focus remains on practising Python fundamentals—loops, conditionals, lists/dictionaries, functions, and modular program structure.

## Target Users
•⁠  ⁠Students who want a simple place to maintain their semester marks  
•⁠  ⁠Anyone who wants to organise subject scores without needing spreadsheets  
•⁠  ⁠Beginners learning Python and practising basic data-handling concepts

## High-Level Features
•⁠  ⁠Add subjects and record marks  
•⁠  ⁠Edit, update, or delete marks for any subject  
•⁠  ⁠View all subjects with individual assessments  
•⁠  ⁠See total marks and average for each subject  
•⁠  ⁠Clear, menu-based navigation  
•⁠  ⁠In-memory system (no file storage) for simplicity
