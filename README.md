# Marks Manager (Python Project)

This is a simple Python program that helps you store, view, and calculate the average of student marks.  
All records are saved in a text file named ⁠ marks.txt ⁠, so the data stays even after closing the program.

## Overview

The project allows the user to add students, store marks for different subjects, update marks, view reports and calculate totals/averages.  
I kept the structure simple so it is easy to run, understand and explain during evaluation.

Everything works in-memory (data resets when program restarts), which keeps the program lightweight and within syllabus limits.

## Features
•⁠  ⁠Add a student's name and marks  
•⁠  ⁠View all saved records  
•⁠  ⁠Calculate average marks  
•⁠  ⁠Automatically loads marks from ⁠ marks.txt ⁠  
•⁠  ⁠Simple menu-based interface  

## Technologies / Tools Used

•⁠  ⁠*Python 3* (core)
•⁠  ⁠*VS Code* for writing and testing the program
•⁠  ⁠*macOS Terminal* to run the script

No external libraries are used — only built-in Python functions, keeping the project fully syllabus-aligned.
